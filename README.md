🧵 FAB Marketplace Parser
A Python script for automatically collecting information about 3D models listed on FAB Marketplace.
This tool was created by a 3D content creator to automate the repetitive process of preparing for sales events on the platform.

🔍 What It Does
Loads your public seller page (no login required)

Scrapes key data from each model:

Title

Direct link

Price

🛠 How to Install ChromeDriver
Open Chrome and go to chrome://settings/help
Copy your Chrome version (e.g. 114.0.5735.90)

Go to ChromeDriver downloads
Find the version that matches your Chrome’s major version (e.g. 114)

Download and extract chromedriver.exe
Place it in the same folder as fab_parser.py

Note: If Chrome updates, you might need to update chromedriver.exe as well.

⚠️ Limitations & Plans
Currently works reliably for up to ~24 assets (then FAB may detect bot)

Roadmap:

Batching requests to bypass anti-bot

Add preview image extraction

Improve error handling

📷 Example
Check output.xlsx for an example of the exported spreadsheet.

📄 License & Usage
For non-commercial use only

Do not use this to scrape other sellers' pages

Intended for original creators managing their own models
